  abstract = {Peatlands historically have acted as a C sink because C-fixation rates exceeded the rate of heterotrophic decomposition. Under future warmer conditions predicted for higher latitudes, however, that balance may shift towards higher rates of heterotrophic respiration leading to the release of previously stored C as CO               2               and CH               4               . The Spruce and Peatlands Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment is designed to test the response of peatlands to climate forcing using a series of warmed enclosures in combination with peat below-ground heating from 0 to +9\textdegree C above ambient conditions. This experimental design allowed a test of chemical changes occurring within peatland soils following five years of warming. We analyzed samples in the uppermost 2m of peat using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) to quantify the relative abundance of carbohydrate and aromatic compounds in the peat. The peat soils were subjected to deep peat heating (DPH) beginning in June of 2014 followed by whole ecosystem warming (WEW) in August of 2015. We found that the relative amounts of labile and recalcitrant chemical compound groups across the full peat depth interval did not significantly change after five years of exposure to warming. This appears the case even though previous studies have shown that net C losses and loss of bulk peat mass to be instability over that time period. Results suggest that the current store of carbon in peatlands are largely compositionally stable leading to no changes the in the ratio of chemical moieties on the initial four-year timescale of this experiment.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Ombrotrophic bogs in southern Patagonia have been examined with regard to paleoclimatic and geochemical research questions but knowledge about organic matter decomposition in these bogs is limited. Therefore, we examined peat humification with depth by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) measurements of solid peat, C/N ratio, and {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N isotope measurements in three bog sites. Peat decomposition generally increased with depth but distinct small scale variation occurred, reflecting fluctuations in factors controlling decomposition. C/N ratios varied mostly between 40 and 120 and were significantly correlated (R2 {$>$} 0.55, p {$<$} 0.01) with FTIR-derived humification indices. The degree of decomposition was lowest at a site presently dominated by Sphagnum mosses. The peat was most strongly decomposed at the driest site, where currently peat-forming vegetation produced less refractory organic material, possibly due to fertilizing effects of high sea spray deposition. Decomposition of peat was also advanced near ash layers, suggesting a stimulation of decomposition by ash deposition. Values of {$\delta$}13C were 26.5 {$\pm$} 2\textperthousand{} in the peat and partly related to decomposition indices, while {$\delta$}15N in the peat varied around zero and did not consistently relate to any decomposition index. Concentrations of DOM partly related to C/N ratios, partly to FTIR derived indices. They were not conclusively linked to the decomposition degree of the peat. DOM was enriched in 13C and in 15N relative to the solid phase probably due to multiple microbial modifications and recycling of N in these N-poor environments. In summary, the depth profiles of C/N ratios, {$\delta$}13C values, and FTIR spectra seemed to reflect changes in environmental conditions affecting decomposition, such as bog wetness, but were dominated by site specific factors, and are further influenced by ash deposition and possibly by sea spray input.},

  abstract = {Peatlands store one-third of the total global soil carbon (C.) despite covering only 3\textendash 4\% of the global land surface. Most peatlands are distributed in mid-high latitude regions and are even in permafrost regions, are sensitive to climate change and are disturbed by wildfire. Although several studies have focused on the impact of historical climate change and regional human activities on the C. accumulation process in these peatlands, the impact of these factors on the stability of the C. pool remains poorly understood. Here, based on the 210Pb age-depth model, we investigated the historical variations of C. stability during the last 150 years for five typical peatlands in the northern Great Khingan Mountains (Northeast China), an area located in a permafrost region that is sensitive to climate change and to wildfires, which have clearly increased due to regional human activities. The results showed that low C. accumulation rates (CARs) and weakly C. stability in studied peatlands before 1900. While, the increasing anthropogenic wildfire frequency and the residual products (e.g. pyrogenic carbon) increased the CARs and C. stability in peatlands from 1900 to 1980. The mean July temperature is the most important climate factor for peatlands C. stability. After 1980, due to the low wildfire frequencies influenced by human policies, increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation not only increased the CARs but also markedly increased the C. stability of the peatlands C. pool in the northern Great Khingan Mountains, especially after 2000. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The decomposition behavior of lignocellulosic materials is related to the taxonomic classes of the parent plant tissues. Thus, methods to characterize the composition of mixtures of lignocellulosic materials such as municipal solid waste (MSW) according to different taxonomic classes of plants are useful. The copper oxide (CuO) oxidation products of lignin provide molecular markers that allow for characterization of the initial plants. The objective of this study was to determine if the chemical composition of the monomers present after CuO oxidation can be used to infer information on the content of woody angiosperms (hardwood\textemdash HW), non-woody angiosperms (leaves and grasses\textemdash LG), woody gymnosperms (softwood\textemdash SW), and non-woody gymnosperms (needles\textemdash GN). Results showed that the composition of HW and SW in synthetic mixtures can be estimated from CuO oxidation products of lignin within an error of \AE 60\% of the expected values. The high uncertainty in the estimate of composition in synthetic mixtures can be attributed to the fact that the components selected for the synthetic mixtures had different CuO oxidation products compared to the average which was used in developing the mixing model. Application of the mixing model to estimate the composition of samples from a Kentucky (KY) landfill showed that the majority of the samples are from HW and SW with little to no non-woody tissues (LG, GN). However, the mixing model is not sufficiently precise to infer more detailed information on MSW composition.

  abstract = {Peatlands represent large terrestrial carbon banks. Given that most peat accumulates in boreal regions, where low temperatures and water saturation preserve organic matter, the existence of peat in (sub)tropical regions remains enigmatic. Here we examined peat and plant chemistry across a latitudinal transect from the Arctic to the tropics. Near-surface low-latitude peat has lower carbohydrate and greater aromatic content than near-surface high-latitude peat, creating a reduced oxidation state and resulting recalcitrance. This recalcitrance allows peat to persist in the (sub)tropics despite warm temperatures. Because we observed similar declines in carbohydrate content with depth in high-latitude peat, our data explain recent field-scale deep peat warming experiments in which catotelm (deeper) peat remained stable despite temperature increases up to 9\,\textdegree C. We suggest that high-latitude deep peat reservoirs may be stabilized in the face of climate change by their ultimately lower carbohydrate and higher aromatic composition, similar to tropical peats.},

  abstract = {Peat accumulation makes nutrient-limited ombrotrophic bogs important carbon sinks, while enhanced atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition threatens this capacity. Here we show that the stoichiometry of peat and porewater, a control of plant growth and decomposition, has been altered in response to long-term N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization at Mer Bleue ombrotrophic bog in eastern Ontario, Canada. In Nfertilized peat, receiving up to an additional 6.4 g N m-2 y-1 above ambient deposition, we found N significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) greater, P both significantly greater and smaller dependent on treatment concentration, calcium (Ca) and K concentrations significantly lower, relative to control plots. In NPK-fertilized peat, P was greater than control while Ca was significantly smaller. In the porewater of N- and NPK-fertilized peat, we observed significantly more ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphate, and dissolved organic phosphorus than in the controls. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that fertilization in all treatments increased decomposition, as indicated by residual enrichment of refractory moieties such as aromatics, carboxylates, and lignin, albeit only in the uppermost depths. Changes in peat quality may, however, not only relate to advanced decomposition but also to changes in litter input, as predominant vascular vegetation in the fertilized plots shared several features in FTIR spectra with samples of uppermost peat layers. Our results demonstrate that the peat in this ombrotrophic bog has responded to long-term fertilization with loss of Sphagnum moss and its filter function, increased shrub cover and enhanced decomposition.},

  abstract = {Abstract. To understand global soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry and its dynamics, we need tools to efficiently quantify SOM properties, for example prediction models using mid infrared spectra. However, the advantages of such models rely on their validity and accuracy. Recently, Hodgkins et al. (2018) developed models to quantitatively predict organic matter holocellulose and Klason lignin contents, two indicators of SOM stability and major fractions of organic matter. The models may have the potential to understand large-scale SOM gradients and have been used in various studies. A research gap to fill is that these models have not been validated in detail yet. What are their limitations and how can we improve them? This study provides a validation with the aim to identify concrete steps to improve these models. As a first step, we provide several improvements using the original training data. The major limitation we identified is that the original training data are not representative for a range of diverse peat samples. This causes both biased estimates and extrapolation uncertainty under the original models. In addition, the original models can in practice produce unrealistic predictions (negative values or values {$>$}100 mass-\%). Our improved models partly reduce the observed bias, have a better predictive performance for the training data, and avoid such unrealistic predictions. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept that holocellulose contents can also be predicted for mineral-rich samples. A key step to improve the models will be to collect training data that is representative for SOM formed under various conditions. This study opens directions to develop operational models to predict SOM holocellulose and Klason lignin contents from mid infrared spectra.}

  abstract = {Peatlands contain a significant fraction of global soil carbon, but how these reservoirs will respond to the changing climate is still relatively unknown. A global picture of the variations in peat organic matter chemistry will aid our ability to gauge peatland soil response to climate. The goal of this research is to test the hypotheses that 1) peat carbohydrate content, an indicator of soil organic matter reactivity, will increase with latitude and decrease with mean annual temperatures (MAT), 2) while peat aromatic content, an indicator of recalcitrance, will vary inversely, and 3) elevation will have a similar effect to latitude. We used Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to examine variations in the organic matter functional groups of 1034 peat samples collected from 10-20, 30-40, and 60-70 cm depths at 165 individual sites across a latitudinal gradient of 79\r{}N to 65\r{}S and from elevations of 0 to 4773 meters. Carbohydrate contents of high latitude peat were significantly greater than peat originating near the equator, while aromatic content showed the opposite trend. For peat from similar latitudes but different elevations, the carbohydrate content was greater and aromatic content was lower at higher elevations. Higher carbohydrate content at higher latitudes indicates a greater potential for mineralization, whereas the chemical composition of low latitude peat is consistent with their apparent relative stability in the face of warmer temperatures. The combination of low carbohydrates and high aromatics at warmer locations near the equator suggests the mineralization of high latitude peat until reaching recalcitrance under a new temperature regime.},
