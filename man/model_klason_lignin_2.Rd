\title{Linear model to predict Klason lignin content from MIR spectra from [---todo:ref]}
\format{
An object of class \code{\link[brms:brmsfit-class]{brms::brmsfit-class()}}.

\source{
The model is described in [---todo:ref]. The data set was derived
from \url{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06050-2} and published

\description{
\code{model_klason_lignin_2} is a linear model to predict
Klason lignin mass fractions [g/g] in samples based on mid infrared spectra.
Predictions with this model can be generated with
\code{\link[=irp_klason_lignin_2]{irp_klason_lignin_2()}}.
}
\details{
The model was trained on the data from \insertCite{Hodgkins.2018;textual}{ir}
(available via \code{\link[ir:ir_sample_data]{ir::ir_sample_data()}}) and is
described in [---todo:ref]. See \code{\link[=model_klason_lignin_2_config]{model_klason_lignin_2_config()}}
for details on how the training spectra were preprocessed prior model
fitting.

The model is an improved version of \code{irp_content_kl_hodgkins_model}
[---todo:ref]. It is a Bayesian beta regression model using all binned
spectral variables for prediction.

\note{
Note that this is a preliminary model only which has not been fully
validated for peat samples yet and which has known limitations in predicting
contents for peat samples [---todo: add reference].
