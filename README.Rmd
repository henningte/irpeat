## Overview

'irpeat' is an R package that contains simple functions to analyze infrared spectra of peat samples. Some functions may also work with organic matter samples in general.

Provided functions for analyzing infrared spectra of peat are:

1. Computation of several humification indices.
2. Klason lignin mass fraction (following @Hodgkins.2018 and @Teickner.2022a) (note that these models are not reliable for peat, see @Teickner.2022a).
3. Holocellulose mass fraction (following @Hodgkins.2018 and @Teickner.2022a) (note that these models are not reliable for peat, see @Teickner.2022a).
4. Peat electron accepting capacity (following @Teickner.2022).
5. Peat electron donating capacity (following @Teickner.2022).

### How to install

You can install 'irpeat' from GitHub using R via:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github(repo = "henningte/irpeat")
```

'irpeat' relies on the R package ['ir'](https://github.com/henningte/ir) for handling infrared spectra.

### How to use

You can load 'irpeat' in R with:

```{r load_irpeat}
library(irpeat)

# load additional packages needed for this tutorial
library(ir)
library(ggplot2)
```

You can test 'irpeat' with sample data from the R package 'ir':

```{r ir_sample_data_load}
ir::ir_sample_data
```

`ir::ir_sample_data` contains various ATR-MIR spectra of organic reference material (e.g. newspaper, wood, grass).

A simple workflow could be, for example, to baseline correct the spectra (using functions of the package 'ir') compute various humification indices and Klason lignin and holocellulose mass fractions in the samples. We use only the first few spectra from `ir::ir_sample_data` to speed the computations a bit up.

```{r sample_data_workflow}
x <- 
  ir::ir_sample_data[1:10, ] %>%                                # data
  ir::ir_bc(method = "rubberband") %>%                          # baseline correction
  irpeat::irp_hi() %>%                                          # humification indices
  irpeat::irp_klason_lignin_2(do_summary = TRUE)                # Klason lignin content
```

`x` is identical to `ir::ir_sample_data[1:10, ]`, but contains additional columns for the computed humification indices (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`) and the computed Klason lignin content (`klason_lignin_2`)

```{r x_inspect}
x
```

Plot of the humification index (ratio of the intensities at 1420 and 1090 cm<sup>-1</sup> [@Broder.2012]) versus the Klason lignin content:

```{r x_plot}
ggplot2::ggplot(x, aes(x = quantities::drop_quantities(klason_lignin_2) * 100, y = hi1)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point() +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Klason lignin content [mass-%]", 
                y = expression("Ratio of the intensities at"~1420~and~1090~cm^{-1}))

```


All computed quantities come with units and standard errors (thanks to the [quantities](https://github.com/r-quantities/quantities) package):

```{r x_klh_inspect_quantities}
x$klason_lignin_2
```

### Future development

Henning Teickner plans, as part of his PhD project, to extensively extent 'irpeat' by developing a set of calibration models that can predict various peat physicochemical properties from mid infrared spectra. These models should be finished by September 2024. Currently, a data compendium ([pmird](https://henningte.github.io/pmird/index.html)) is developed to collect the data required for this task.
